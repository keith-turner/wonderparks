Hey America, over the next 500 years lets build 50 wonders in new national
parks. A wonder is an enormous work of art.  We can do this following the
simple democratic process outlined below.

 1. In a ceremony in the capital building overseen by the senate the president
    randomly picks three state names from a hat.
 2. Following their own democratic process the three states each create a proposal
    for a new national park in the state with a wonder in it.
 3. Working together the Congressional Budget Office and U.S. Army Corp of
    Engineers will asses the cost, viability, and durability of each proposal
    and publish a report.
 4. A national vote will be held to select one of the states proposals using a
    ranked choice vote.  A fourth option of none will be offered as a choice
    when voting.  If none wins, then this process starts over with three new states.
 5. The winning state is granted a budget by congress and given 10 years to
    build its new wonder and allocate land for the new national park.
 6. During the 10 years while the winning state is toiling away, the selection
    process for the next state can start.

This proposal is a work in progress.  Please do not share it until its complete.
